# Linear regression with total least squares

[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares) give a good description of the method. Code for the method was difficult to find, so I decided to make and share my own implementation in Python. The method uses eigendecomposition of covariance matrix. It is probably not the fastest method, but works.
